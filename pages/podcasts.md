[Software Engineering Radio](http://www.se-radio.net): A Markus Voelter creation pursuing a more academic review of current software engineering trends by the experts leading the way. Later (2012) supported by _IEEE Software_, a great fit, and remains true to the original vision. 

[The Changelog](https://changelog.com): Focuses on the Open Source ecosystem: personalities, entrepreneurial efforts, languages, frameworks, modern development practices. I am continually impressed with the quality of interviews and interviewees.
